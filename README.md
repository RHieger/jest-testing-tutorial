# Jest Tutorial&mdash;JavaScript Unit Testing Using Jest Framework

## Software Testing Help (https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com)

This repository contains all exercises that are part of the tutorial found
at this link: [Jest Testing Tutorial](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/jest-testing-tutorial/).

I have covered every kind of test included in the tutorial. However, for the time being, I have omitted the section on hooks available in Jest. I
intend to come back to this as soon as possible.
